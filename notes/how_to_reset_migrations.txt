Step1: Go through each of your projects apps migration folder and remove everything inside, except the __init__.py file.
     For linux use
     find . -path "*/migrations/*.py" -not -name "__init__.py" -delete
     find . -path "*/migrations/*.pyc"  -delete

Step2. Drop the current database, or delete the db.sqlite3 if it is your case.


python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
